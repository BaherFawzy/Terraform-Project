# Terraform Project

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automating the provisioning of cloud infrastructure using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## Features

- Automated deployment of resources in a cloud environment
- Easily customizable for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Supports major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed (version >= 1.0)
- Cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS IAM user with proper permissions)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaherFawzy/Terraform-Project.git
   cd Terraform-Project
   ```

2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Customize variables (if needed):
   Edit the `variables.tf` file to match your environment.

4. Plan the infrastructure changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the changes to deploy resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.tf`: Contains the primary configuration for provisioning infrastructure.
- `variables.tf`: Defines variables to customize the project.
- `outputs.tf`: Lists the output values from Terraform after running.
- `provider.tf`: Specifies the cloud provider and its configuration.

## Notes

- Make sure to securely handle sensitive credentials using environment variables or Terraform's `terraform.tfvars` file.
- Use `terraform destroy` to remove resources when they are no longer needed.
